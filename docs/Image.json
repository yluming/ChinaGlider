    "global_style_prompt": "Visual style inspired by Eugene Galien-Laloue: soft, painterly realism; impressionistic atmosphere; delicate brushstroke texture; balanced composition; gentle depth and perspective; subtle grain and canvas texture.\n\nLighting: natural light, luminous and airy, with enhanced brightness and clarity.\nColor palette: brighter and more vivid than classic Galien-Laloue, with fresh blues, soft greens, warm sunlight tones, and gentle contrast — optimistic, calm, and inviting, not muted or melancholic.\n\nMood: quiet elegance, contemplative, human-scaled, timeless but approachable.\n\nPeople: realistic proportions, non-stylized, no exaggerated expressions. Faces should be subtle or partially obscured; avoid strong facial features or identity cues.\n\nCamera: eye-level or slightly distant perspective, cinematic but restrained.\nNo modern filters, no illustration style, no cartoon, no digital surrealism.",
