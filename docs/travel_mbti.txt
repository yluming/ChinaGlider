## Appendix · Scoring & Result Logic (for the Model)

### 1) Goal

Map the user’s answers across **4 psychological dimensions**, then output **1 of 16 Travel Soul Spectrum archetypes**.

---

### 2) Dimensions & Sides

Each dimension has two opposing sides:

1. **Self-Expansion Motive**

   * **Soul Seeker** (high self-expansion)
   * **Pleasure Seeker** (low self-expansion)

2. **Place Resonance**

   * **Connector** (high resonance)
   * **Wanderer** (low resonance)

3. **Openness to Experience**

   * **Explorer** (high openness)
   * **Comfort Keeper** (low openness)

4. **Structuration / Planning**

   * **Architect** (high structure/planning)
   * **Flow Walker** (low structure/go-with-the-flow)

---

### 3) Scoring Rules (Simple, Deterministic)

**General rule:**
Every selected option adds points to one (or multiple) sides. No negative points.

**Weights by question type:**

* **Phase 1 text questions (Q1–Q4):** weight **1.0**
* **Phase 2 image questions (Q5–Q8):** weight **1.5**
* **Phase 3 integrative questions:**

  * **Q9:** weight **2.0**
  * **Q10:** weight **1.0** (multi-select, max 2 options)
  * **Q11:** weight **1.0**
  * **Q12:** weight **0.5**

Implementation: multiply each awarded point by the weight.

---

### 4) Answer-to-Score Mapping (by question)

#### Q1 (Text) — Self-Expansion

* A → Soul Seeker **+1.0**
* B → Pleasure Seeker **+1.0**

#### Q2 (Text) — Place Resonance

* A → Connector **+1.0**
* B → Wanderer **+1.0**

#### Q3 (Text) — Openness

* A → Explorer **+1.0**
* B → Comfort Keeper **+1.0**

#### Q4 (Text) — Structuration / Planning

* A → Architect **+1.0**
* B → Flow Walker **+1.0**

---

#### Q5 (Image) — Self-Expansion

* A → Soul Seeker **+1.5**
* B → Pleasure Seeker **+1.5**

#### Q6 (Image) — Place Resonance

* A → Connector **+1.5**
* B → Wanderer **+1.5**

#### Q7 (Image) — Openness

* A → Explorer **+1.5**
* B → Comfort Keeper **+1.5**

#### Q8 (Image) — Structuration / Planning

* A → Architect **+1.5**
* B → Flow Walker **+1.5**

---

#### Q9 (Scenario, single choice) — Integrative

* A → Architect **+2.0**
* B → Flow Walker **+1.0** AND Explorer **+1.0**
* C → Soul Seeker **+2.0**
* D → Pleasure Seeker **+2.0**

---

#### Q10 (Memory, multi-select, up to 2)

For each selected option (max 2):

* A → Soul Seeker **+1.0**
* B → Pleasure Seeker **+1.0**
* C → Connector **+1.0**
* D → Architect **+1.0**

> Constraint: if user selects 2 options, each gets full +1.0 (no splitting). If the product requires splitting later, do it in code, not in the prompt.

---

#### Q11 (Image, single choice) — Cross-signal

* A → Architect **+1.0** AND Soul Seeker **+1.0**
* B → Connector **+1.0** AND Pleasure Seeker **+1.0**
* C → Explorer **+1.0** AND Wanderer **+1.0**

---

#### Q12 (Sound, single choice) — Emotional calibration (light weight)

* A → Connector **+0.5** AND Pleasure Seeker **+0.5**
* B → Wanderer **+0.5** AND Soul Seeker **+0.5**

---

### 5) Final Type Decision (Deterministic)

1. Sum scores for each side within each dimension.

   * Dimension 1: Soul Seeker vs Pleasure Seeker
   * Dimension 2: Connector vs Wanderer
   * Dimension 3: Explorer vs Comfort Keeper
   * Dimension 4: Architect vs Flow Walker

2. For each dimension, choose the side with the higher score.

   * If tied: break ties using the **higher-weight questions** in this order:
     **Q9 > Q5–Q8 > Q1–Q4 > Q10/Q11/Q12**
   * If still tied: default to the **Phase 2 (image) choice** for that dimension.

3. Combine the 4 chosen sides to form one of 16 archetypes.
